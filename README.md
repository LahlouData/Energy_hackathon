I had the pleasure to participate to the energy hack Hackathon organized by MAP LAB BI & BIG DATA. 
The goal is to optimize the strategy energical of the French Ministry of Arms by identifying an innovative solution with data analysis and Artificial intelligence.
The slogan of this scientific meeting was: "Consume safe, consume better and consume less".
My contribution was as a data assistant. I worked on the formatting of the input data
